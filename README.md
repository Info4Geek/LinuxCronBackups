LinuxCronBackups
================

Automated simple backup script for Linux.
MySQL backup included and FTP transfer.
Backups are therefore on hard disk and on remote FTP server.


Before start script you must do this:
-------------------------

1. Open a terminal or connect with SSH to your server

2. Install requiered paquets (rsync ncftp crontab):
- Debian, Ubuntu, ... : apt-get install rsync ncftp crontab
- Fedora: yum install rsync ncftp crontab
- OpenSUSE: zypper install rsync ncftp crontab
- ArchLinux: pacman -S rsync ncftp crontab
- Other: Google > "distribution_name install paquet"

3. Create save folders:
```mkdir /var/backup && mkdir /var/backup/rsync && mkdir /var/backup/final```

4. Edit following lines in the script with your needs:
```mysqldump >> --password=MySQLRootPassword```
```rsync >> /folder/do/you/want/to/backup/```
```ncftpput >> -u username
			-p password
			serveradress
			"/remote/repertory"```
You can also edit the default working folder. 
On my script default working folder is /var/backup

5. You can add other rsync lines if you want to backup more folders and files

6. Make the script executable:
```chmod +x /location/of/bacup_script```

7. Cron your script for backups occur automatically when you want.
```$crontab -e```
Add on the end of the file this:
```0 5 * * * bash /location/of/bacup_script```
In this case the backup will every day at 5am, you can change the time when baccup occur with your needs following the functioning of Cron.
